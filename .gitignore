# C#/.NET, Visual Studio, and Rider gitignore template
#
# General Explanation:
#
# / - A forward slash at the beginning of a pattern matches files and directories
#     only in the root of the repository.
#
# * - An asterisk is a wildcard that matches zero or more characters.
#
# ** - A double asterisk is a wildcard that matches any number of directories.
#
# ! - An exclamation mark at the beginning of a pattern negates it. This is used
#     to re-include a file that was excluded by a previous pattern.
